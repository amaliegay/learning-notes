Requirements: Node.js

To get started with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/), open the terminal and navigate up one directory from the target directory. For example, if you would like the project scaffolded in `D:\react-with-vite`, run the below command in `D:\`.

```powershell
npm create vite@latest
```

Then, run:

```powershell
cd $PROJECT_NAME
npm install
npm run dev
```
